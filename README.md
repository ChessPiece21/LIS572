# LIS 572, Autumn 2022
My work for LIS 572 Introduction to Data Science, in the MLIS program at the University of Washington.
<br><br>
I took this course in my first quarter of the MLIS program, with [Dr. Melanie Walsh](https://melaniewalsh.org/) as my instructor. This class was foundational to my interests in Digital Humanities and data curation and management, and I am so happy to have taken it in my first quarter!
